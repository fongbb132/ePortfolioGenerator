        in this class is a discussion essay on massive open online courses(MOOCs). In this essay, we needed to review a particular  debate or topic  reviewing the arguments and opinions of both supporters and opponents of MOOCs. The objective was to  write an unbiased discussion without any personal opinions and arguments. Writing this assignment helped me to open my mind to learning the arguments from both sides and learn about the issue as a third person. The challenge in this assignment for me was to keep my personal arguments and opinions out of my essay because I already had my own stance for MOOCs before writing this essay. After completing this essay, I learned how to keep my own thoughts away and analyze issues from both sides objectively.
